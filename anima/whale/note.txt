     Research into baleen whale behavior is ongoing. Some behaviors may be interpreted as being related to food-gathering, aggression, excitement, warning, visual inspection, or mating. Some baleen whales slap their pectoral flippers, tail flukes, or head on the surface of the water, which creates loud sounds under water.
