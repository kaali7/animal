     Cows differ widely in temperament. Some are always gentle; others are quite active, alert, and somewhat nervous under normal conditions and very excitable under stress. Most cows exhibit normal behavior patterns and respond to kindness and superior herd management.
     Cows are smart, social animals. They have a rich repertoire of communication that includes moos, grunts, bellows and even non-verbal signals such as tail position.
     According to research, cows are generally quite intelligent animals who can remember things for a long time. Animal behaviorists have found that they interact in socially complex ways, developing friendships over time and sometimes holding grudges against other cows who treat them badly.
     Cows eat grass and hay. On a dry matter basis a cow will eat 4 to 5 tons of forage per year. As long as there is pasture for the cows to eat it is most economical to let them graze.
