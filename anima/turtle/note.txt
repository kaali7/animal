     Sea turtles are generally solitary creatures that remain submerged for much of the time they are at sea, which makes them extremely difficult to study. They rarely interact with one another outside of courtship and mating. Ridleys, however, do come together in massive groups during nesting.
     Turtles aren't the chattiest animals. ... While turtles do not have vocal cords, they have adapted to use nonvocal communication to express a wide array of information. They can even produce hissing sounds and other low-frequency sounds
     Researchers have found that turtles possess instinctual intelligence which contributes to their ability to survive in the wild by scavenging for food and being alert for predators. Additionally, it has been proven that turtles can retain experiences that occur and learn from them.
     Animal-based food sources for turtles can include processed pet foods like drained sardines, turtle pellets, and trout chow. You can also feed them cooked chicken, beef, and turkey. Live prey can include moths, crickets, shrimp, krill, feeder fish, and worms
