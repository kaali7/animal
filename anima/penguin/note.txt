     Penguins exhibit intricate courting and mate-recognition behavior. Elaborate visual and vocal displays help establish and maintain nesting territories. Although king penguins are highly gregarious at rookery sites, they usually travel in small groups of 5 to 20 individuals.
     Penguins communicate by vocalizing and performing physical behaviors called displays. They use many vocal and visual displays to communicate nesting territories, mating information, nest relief rituals, partner and chick recognition, and defense against intruders.
     Intelligence doesn't just mean cleverness, says David Powell, Director of Research at the St. Louis Zoo. ... But their intelligence can be compared to corvids in several ways, she says. For example, penguins hunt cooperatively, just like brown-necked ravens.
     Penguins eat krill (a shrimp-like crustacean in the family Euphausiidae), squids, and fishes. Various species of penguins have slightly different food preferences, which reduce competition among species.
