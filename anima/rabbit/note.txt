     Rabbits are very intelligent and active animals. They spend a huge amount of their time foraging for food, but they also need to dig, hide, run jump and stretch. Providing the right diet, companionship and environment are all essential to making sure that they can behave as normal.
     Rabbits are capable of some vocalizations that they use for communication, which sometimes surprises owners. ... Grunting, Growling, Snorting, and Hissing: all communicate varied stages of anger, stress, or feeling threatened. Soft Honking or Oinking: communicates sexual interest. Screaming: a sign of extreme pain or fear.
     Rabbits are intelligent social animals who need affection. They can become wonderful companion animals if given a chance to interact with their human families. ... A well cared for rabbit can give you 7 to 10 years of companionship.
     Rabbits should have a daily diet of mostly hay, a smaller amount of fresh vegetables, and a limited number of pellets. Hay is the most important part of a rabbit's daily intake. Unlimited, high-quality grass hay, such as Timothy, orchard or brome, should make up the bulk of a rabbit's diet.
