     Lions are highly territorial and occupy the same area for generations. Females actively defend their territories against other females, while resident males protect prides from rival coalitions. Territory size depends on prey abundance, as well as access to water and denning sites.
     Lions communicate in many different ways using sounds like roars, grunts, moans, growls, snarls, purrs, hums, puffs and woofs, as well as body language. Each sound and gesture has a different meaning. ... Life in Africa is good: Lions and lionesses purr and lick or gnaw at each other.
     In a follow-up experiment using a similar conceptual puzzle, lions outperformed leopards and tigers (which are both solitary big cats)â€”more evidence for the social intelligence hypothesis. But Borrego acknowledges that habitat and diet could also be factors in cognitive evolution.
     Lions are carnivores, which means they are animals that only eat meat. Some of the types of prey they catch include birds, hares, turtles, mice, lizards, wild hogs, wild dogs, antelopes, cheetahs, buffaloes, leopards, crocodiles, baby elephants, rhinoceros, hippopotamuses, and  tall giraffes!
