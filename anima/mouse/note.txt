     Mice are nocturnal, meaning they like to sleep during the day. This is why pet mice or house mice can be heard playing or foraging during the night. Most wild mice are timid toward humans and other animals, but they are very social with other mice. ... According to the RSPCA, mice are very territorial.
     Mice establish family groups, territories and complex social structures. They communicate with each other in a variety of ways, using their mouths, noses, ears and bodies. Much of their vocal communication is outside the human hearing range, though you can hear some squeaks in their lower voice range.
     Rats and mice are highly intelligent rodents. They are natural students who excel at learning and understanding concepts. Rats are considerably smaller than dogs, but they are at least as capable of thinking about things and figuring them out as dogs are!
     Chocolate and peanut butter are favorites — and they apparently love hazelnut spread as well, according to Terminix. Mice love a lot of foods, but of course, they have some they like better than others — and according to Orkin, cheese is lower on the list than you might expect.
