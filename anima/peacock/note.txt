     Although peacocks don't get along with many other birds, they are social with each other, and groups of them are called parties. It's typically only older peacocks that stay by themselves. Peacocks sleep in tall trees, which is called roosting, to protect themselves from other animals.
     When threatened, they also fan their tails out in order to look larger and intimidating. When the peacock quivers his feathers, they emit a low-frequency sound inaudible to humans. The peacock can change the sound to communicate different messages
     Which was remarkable, Webster said, because, in general, peacocks are not very smart. “They're about as bright as a domesticated turkey, which is to say, they ain't got much going for them,” he said. Still, the birds are attractive, and people love them.
     Peafowl are omnivores which means they will eat both vegetation and meat. Wild peacocks eat fruit, berries, grains, ants, flower petals and plants. Captive peafowl will also eat cat food, cheese, nuts, scrambled egg, cooked rice and kitchen scraps.
