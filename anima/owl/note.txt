     About Owls. Most Owls are active at dusk and dawn, spending the daytime at a quiet, inconspicuous roost. They can be found roosting singly or in pairs or family groups, but may form flocks outside of the breeding season (A group of Owls is called a parliament).
     In addition to hoots, owls may chirp, whistle, scream, screech, bark, growl, or shriek. Scientists call these different sounds vocalizations. ... Most owls make these sounds in order to communicate. And there are just as many messages as there are different types of calls!
     Owls don't have such relatively large, well-developed brains, and when tested in captivity haven't shown above-average intelligence. In western cultures, the myth of the wise owl might have arisen because Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, is often portrayed with an owl on her shoulder.
     Owls are Birds of Prey, which means that they must kill other animals to survive. Their diet includes invertebrates (such as insects, spiders, earthworms, snails and crabs), fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds and small mammals.
