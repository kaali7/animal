     Dolphins are capable of complex problem solving and social interaction. They are one of the smartest animals in the world. Research into the behavior of dolphins in the wild and in captivity has yielded incredible data on the intelligence of these marine mammals.
     Dolphins are active predators and eat a wide variety of fishes, squids, and crustaceans such as shrimps. The foods available to a dolphin vary with its geographic location. Dolphins show strong preferences for certain species of food fish. Coastal dolphins tend to eat fishes and bottom-dwelling invertebrates.
