     Alligators are predators and are nocturnalâ€”that is, active mostly at night. During the day they often lie at the water's edge in large numbers, sunning themselves. At night they retreat to the water, where they live solitary lives and establish individual territories.
     To communicate in water, an alligator communicates by slapping the water. During mating season, the male alligator does a head slap on the water to send signals out to the female alligator. Because sound travels faster in water, the head slap technique can allow long-distance communication.
     They might have a reputation for being tough, but alligators are amongst the most attentive parents in the reptile world, remaining with their young for as long as three years. They are also highly intelligent, and have been known to use tools.
     Alligators are nocturnal and feed primarily at night. Younger alligators eat insects, shrimps, snails, small fish, tadpoles and frogs. Adult alligators eat fish, birds, turtles, other reptiles and mammals. Alligators swallow their prey whole.
