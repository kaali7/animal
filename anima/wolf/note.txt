     Wolves are complex, highly intelligent animals who are caring, playful, and above all devoted to family. Only a select few other species exhibit these traits so clearly. Just like elephants, gorillas and dolphins, wolves educate their young, take care of their injured and live in family groups.
     Wolves use their sense of smell to communicate through chemical messages. These chemical messages between members of the same species are known as pheromones. Sources of pheromones in wolves include glands on the toes, tail, eyes, anus, genitalia and skin.
     In fact, wolves can be quite intelligent, they just don't care too much about humans, and therefore perform poorly in tasks that require them to engage socially with us. ... As we found some behavioral variability in our wolves, this species might have been predisposed for successful selection to take place.
     Wolves are carnivoresâ€”they prefer to eat large hoofed mammals such as deer, elk, bison, and moose. They also hunt smaller mammals such as beavers, rodents, and hares. Adults can eat 20 pounds of meat in a single meal.
