     Bulls are notorious for their unpredictable aggression. Some bulls may mount others, and these may respond with aggression. Such fights can end with serious injuries and even death, especially if the bulls are horned. Dairy bulls are commonly more aggressive (and also larger and heavier) than beef bulls.
     Cows can communicate with each other using visual or vocal signs. Visual communication is used to indicate aggressive and reproductive states. It is less subtle in leashed animals compared to moving animals, and the tail is a vital signaling device in visual communication.
     According to research, cows are generally quite intelligent animals who can remember things for a long time. Animal behaviorists have found that they interact in socially complex ways, developing friendships over time and sometimes holding grudges against other cows who treat them badly.
     All bulls will eat the same diet of roughages, grains, oilseeds, and by-products, but the percentage of each may change. The general rule is to feed them just under 2% of their body weight unless they're about to go to the market. Adult bulls will typically need around 7% protein and 46% total digestible nutrients.
