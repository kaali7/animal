     Deer are relatively shy animals which may give the impression that there are fewer around than there actually are. They are alert to danger and will respond quickly, usually by running away and/or seeking cover but sometimes lying up in or running into wide open areas where they can assess threats.
     Deer have all kinds of ways to communicate with each other besides sound, including smell, sight and even taste. Like dogs, a deer's tail can send signals. ... The glands are found between their hooves, leaving a scent as they walk, as well as on the eyes, between their ears, inside the nose and one just above their tail
     Keen senses of smell, vision and hearing have a lot to do with deer "intelligence." Deer often sense the presence of hunters long before hunters sense them
     Grasses, sedges, the leaves and shoots of trees and other woody plants are all on the menu. Fruit and berries are sometimes eaten too, while tree bark is taken when other food is scarce.
