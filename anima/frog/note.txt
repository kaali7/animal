     While many frogs have relatively simple social behaviours, the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) have evolved complex social and spatial behaviours reminiscent of many mammals and birds (Summers, 1989, Summers and Tumulty, 2013): they are territorial
     Frogs and toads have vocal cords, just like humans, but they also have a vocal sac, which works like an inflatable amplifier. To start calling, a frog breathes in and then closes its nostrils. It forces the air backward and forward between its lungs and vocal sac, so that its vocal cords can make the air vibrate.
     In fact, among the amphibians, the anurans, or frogs and toads, are perhaps the most intelligent, and have the largest brain to body ratio of the amphibians.
     While crickets are the most common frog food, it is important to offer your frog a varied diet, including grasshoppers, locusts, mealworms, and, for some larger species, small mice.
