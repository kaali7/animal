     The giraffe is not a territorial creature. They live in herds that are open with no obvious leader. The social behavior of giraffes is very informal and the individuals in the herds are often changing. Their need to spend a large portion of their day foraging for food makes them more independent than most herd animals.
     Humans cannot hear most of the communication between giraffes because they communicate infrasonically, with moans and grunts too low for humans to hear. Mother giraffes sometimes use whistles to warn or call their young. Other ways giraffes communicate are with their eyes and by touching other giraffes in the herd.
     Physically, giraffes are quiet, extremely tall, have excellent eyesight and are considered very intelligent. The intelligence of giraffes is a factor in how quickly they adapt behaviourally in response to changing external stimuli.
     Giraffe are predominantly browsers and mainly eat leaves and buds on trees and shrubs. They will also eat herbs, climbers and vines, and prefer flowers and fruit when in season. The proportion of grass in their diet is very low.
