Chickens have a rigid social structure called the “pecking order” by which every bird establishes who is dominant and who is submissive in relationship to every other bird. Dominant birds peck at submissive birds, pluck their feathers, and may chase them away or steal their food.
All animals have their own unique way of communicating with each other. For chickens, that communication is mostly vocal. Hens and roosters like to make themselves heard, and they use a variety of sounds to indicate different thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
A recent study has shown that chickens are intelligent and emotional animals, and are able to "demonstrate thinking skills on par with mammals and primates". If you hide an object from a chicken, they will still know it's there — this is something even young human kids aren't able to do.
Select fruits, vegetables and grains will keep chickens happy and ensure they are receiving a nutritionally balanced diet. Good choices include leafy greens, cooked beans, corn, non-sugary cereals and grains, berries, apples and most other fruits and vegetables.
