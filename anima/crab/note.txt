     Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns such as communicating by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be aggressive towards one another, and males often fight to gain access to females.
     Stridulation is the act of producing sound by rubbing certain body parts together, such as insects do when they rub their legs. Scientists have known that crabs use this same leg-rubbing technique to communicate, as well as specialized ridges on the claws and arms that are rubbed together to produce noise.
     A species of crab can learn to navigate a maze and still remember it up to two weeks later. The discovery demonstrates that crustaceans, which include crabs, lobsters and shrimp, have the cognitive capacity for complex learning, even though they have much smaller brains than other animals, such as bees.
     Walnuts, peanut butter, fresh rose or sunflower petals, honey, oatmeal and wheat germ offer a nice change to fruits and vegetables. Sardines, blood worms and meal worms are appealing, as is the meat you eat.
