     Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers.
     In addition to the quantity of vocalizations emit- ted by pinnipeds is the surprising diversity of the sounds themselves, which have been categorized by listeners as clicks, creaks, bleats, growls, barks, whinnies, buzzes, grunts, snorts, songs, pulses, trills, thumps, blasts, groans, sirens, sweeps, yelps, roars, hums
     A pinniped has a long-term memory that enables it to understand and gain the desired behavior after training. ... They demonstrated that they understand simple commands and syntax if they are taught human-made sign language but they could hardly use the signs logically or semantically
     Pinnipeds around the world eat a wide variety of food, ranging from krill in the Southern Ocean through crustaceans and molluscs to fish and squid. Some leopard seals even specialise in eating penguins. Pinnipeds have few natural predators, the main ones being killer whales, some sharks, polar bears and man.
