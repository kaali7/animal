     Horses are naturally highly social animals. A normal healthy horse would never live alone by choice. When horses live in a herd situation (either in the free living or domestic state) they have a rich and varied social life that includes activities such as play behaviour and mutual grooming behaviour.
     Horses have two basic forms of communicationâ€“vocal and body language. The more sophisticated of the two by far is body language. ... With a mere look, a flick of the ears, or a turn of the head, horses can communicate to each other and to us, if we learn to understand their body language.
     A recent study suggests that horses can indeed match voices to faces when presented with humans they know. In other words, your horse can tell you apart from other humans not just by your voice, but your face too. They also learn to recognise your smell, according to numerous other sources.
     In simple terms, horses eat grass and hay or haylage, but salt, concentrates and fruits or vegetables can also enhance their diets, depending on the required work regime and available feed. Here's our Horse Feeding Guide, containing a handy list of everything your average adult horse should eat to remain healthy.
