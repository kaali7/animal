     Zebra Behaviour. Zebras are very courageous animals and are not afraid to confront predators. Zebras also have a powerful kick which can cause serious injury to a predator such as a lion, hyena or African wild dog. Zebras are gregarious animals who congregate in herds of up to 1000 individuals.
     Zebras communicate with facial expressions and sounds. They make loud braying or barking sounds and soft snorting sounds. The position of their ears, how wide open their eyes are, and whether they show their teeth all send a signal. For example, ears flat back means trouble, or "you better follow orders!"
     n short, zebras are intelligent social animals. Though they cannot be tamed like horses and donkeys, they are kept captive in zoos. Already some species of this animal are extinct (like Quagga â€“ a subspecies of plains zebra) and some are endangered.
     Zebras are herbivores and feed mostly by grazing on grasses, although they also might browse a bit on the leaves and stems of bushes. They graze for many hours each day, using their strong front teeth to clip off the tips of the grass. Their back teeth then crush and grind the food.
