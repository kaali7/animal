# Animal 

Hey! I'm Ashwini

At just 16, I've successfully completed my first GUI project, marking an exciting milestone in my programming journey. It's a great feeling to create user-friendly interfaces

Our Python GUI project provides information about a variety of animal species, including cats, dogs, rats, and more. With a user-friendly interface, you can easily browse through different species and learn about their behavior, diet, habitat, and other interesting facts. One of the unique features of our project is the ability to listen to the voices of these animals. By simply clicking a button, you can hear the distinctive sounds of cats, dogs, rats, and other animals. This interactive element adds excitement to the learning experience and helps you to better understand each animal.
